/**
 * The MarcXchange listener is an interface for catching events while
 * reading from ISO 2709 / MARC format family streams.
 * 
 * Each record is framed by a leader and a trailer event. The leader
 * event fires directly after the begin of a record when a leader element
 * is found, the trailer (which is not defined in ISO 2709/MarcXchange) is fired 
 * just before the record ends. The trailer event is useful for post-processing
 * fields before the record end event is fired.
 * 
 * Data field events are fired in the sequence they are found in a record.
 * Sub fields can be nested in data fields, but at most for one nesting level.
 * 
 * Control fields are defined as data fields in the tag range from 000 to 009.
 * They do not have any indicators or sub fields.
 * 
 * Field data is carried only in the end events, where begin events carry
 * information about field indicators and subfield identifiers.
