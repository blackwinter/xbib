/**
 * The Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) is an application
 * programming interface (API) that provides naming and directory
 * functionality to applications written using the Java programming language.
 * It is defined to be independent of any specific directory service
 * implementation. Thus a variety of directories - new, emerging, and already
 * deployed - can be accessed in a common way.
 * <p>
 * The JNDI architecture consists of an API and a service provider
 * interface (SPI). Java applications use the JNDI API to access a variety of
 * naming and directory services. The SPI enables a variety of naming and
 * directory services to be plugged in transparently, thereby allowing the
 * Java application using the JNDI API to access their services.
 * <p>
 * The javax.naming.spi package provides the means by which developers
 * of different naming/directory service providers can develop and hook up
 * their implementations so that the corresponding services are accessible
 * from applications that use the JNDI.
 * <p>
 * The javax.naming.spi package allows different implementations to be
 * plugged in dynamically. These implementations include those for the initial
 * context and for contexts that can be reached from the initial context.
 * <p>
 * The first thing you must do when you use a JNDI naming service is to
 * obtain a context in which you can add and find names. The context that
 * represents the entire name space is known as the initial context. You need
 * to have an initial context, since all of the operations that you can
 * perform on naming and directory services are performed relative to a
 * context.
 * <p>
 * In Java code, you represent the initial context with an instance of
 * the javax.naming.InitialContext class. As mentioned earlier in this
 * chapter, this class implements the javax.naming.Context interface that
 * defines methods for examining and updating bindings within a naming
 * service.
