        xbib ("extensible bibliographic information base") is an effort 
        for transitioning massive amounts of bibliographic catalog data into 
        modern web technologies. 
        </p>
        <p>
        With xbib, you can read record-centered, punchcard-oriented data chunks,
        transform them into semantic entities, and receive results in 
        schema-less, scalable search solutions, using JSON, XML, and RDF.
